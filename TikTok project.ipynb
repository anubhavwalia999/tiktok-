    "\n",
    "Yes, one can recommend this model because it performed well on both the validation and test holdout data. Furthermore, both precision and F<sub>1</sub> scores were consistently high. The model very successfully classified claims and opinions.\n",

    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's most predictive features were all related to the user engagement levels associated with each video. It was classifying videos based on how many views, likes, shares, and downloads they received.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the model currently performs nearly perfectly, there is no need to engineer any new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**\n",

If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n",
